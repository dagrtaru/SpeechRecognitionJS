# SpeechRecognitionJS
A browser based simple speech recognition that hates me. It uses SpeechRecognition and SpeechSynthesisUtterance APIs and is supported only on chrome. Check out the APIs here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance
